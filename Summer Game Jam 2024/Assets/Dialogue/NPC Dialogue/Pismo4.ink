First time at Pismo Beach? Welcome!
Fantastic view of the green California hills and coastline!
Strong, cool breezes and that salty sweet smell of the waves crashing!
Several seagull attacks on the beach all year round, with a 75 year long power struggle between the gulls and the Pismo coast guard vying for control of the beach territory!
Clam chowder!
What more could you want from a place like this!?
