Donâ€™t miss out on a stroll down to Old Fisherman's Wharf. You can enjoy some fresh seafood and sometimes even spot seals and sea lions along the way.
Once when I visited with my partner, I saw some seals barking while coasting past the wharf.
I wanted to take a picture and pulled out my phone. A moment later, I found myself falling into the water!
After a short rescue and about a gallon of water shot out of my nose, my partner told me what had happened.
Apparently a seagull flew by and smacked me straight in the back, causing me to fall off the wharf and into the ocean.
That's the last time I sit on a fence next to a big drop.
