What's cool around here besides the Aquarium?
Definitely visit Cannery Row, itâ€™s got a lot of history and charming shops. Plus, it's just a short walk from the aquarium.
Yeah I know it's still aquarium related but there's only so much you can get out of a bay town like this.
Has anyone mentioned kayaking?

#open shop
Yup I do sell, by the way there's an amazing crepe place there as well, one of my favorite dessert places to eat in while here in my opinion.

See you around! Have found in Monterey!
