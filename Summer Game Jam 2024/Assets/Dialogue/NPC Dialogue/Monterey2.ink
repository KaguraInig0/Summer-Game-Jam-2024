What's cool around here besides the Aquarium?
Definitely visit Cannery Row, itâ€™s got a lot of history and charming shops. Plus, it's just a short walk from the aquarium.
There's an amazing crepe place there as well, one of my favorite dessert places to eat in while here in my opinion.
Yeah I know it's still aquarium related but there's only so much you can get out of a bay town like this.
Has anyone mentioned kayaking?
