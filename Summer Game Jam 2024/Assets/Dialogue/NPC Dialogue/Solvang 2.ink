I once visited this place a couple years ago with my family.
If you've never been here before, check out Paula's Pancake House!
Haven't forgotten the taste of the Danish Pancakes ever since.
Be sure to try it out while you're here!
(We did not implement eating so you have know idea what this guy's talking about)
